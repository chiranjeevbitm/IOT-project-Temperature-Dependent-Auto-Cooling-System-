Sensor interface with Raspberry Pi 


      Connect pin 1 of DHT sensor to the 3.3V pin of Raspberry Pi.
      
      Connect pin 2 of DHT sensor to any input pins of Raspberry Pi, here we have used pin 11.
      
      Connect pin 4 of DHT sensor to the ground pin of the Raspberry Pi.
      
      
Relay interface with Raspberry Pi 


      Connect the VCC pin of relay to the 5V supply pin of Raspberry Pi.
      
      Connect the GND (ground) pin of relay to the ground pin of Raspberry Pi.
      
      Connect the input/signal pin of Relay to the assigned output pin of Raspberry Pi (Here we have used pin 7).
      
      
      
Connection: Relay 
     Connect the relay pins with the Raspberry Pi as mentioned in previous slides 
     Set the GPIO pin connected with the relayâ€™s input pin as output in the sketch
     Set the relay pin high when the temperature is greater than 30 


Connection: Fan 

     Connect the Li-po battery in series with the fan.
     
           NO terminal of the relay -> positive terminal of the Fan.
           
           Common terminal of the relay -> Positive terminal of the battery.
           
           Negative terminal of the battery -> Negative terminal of the fan.
           
           
      Run the existing code. The fan should operate when the surrounding temperature is greater than the threshold value in the sketch
