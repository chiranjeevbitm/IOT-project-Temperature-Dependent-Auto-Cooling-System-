# IOT-project-Temperature-Dependent-Auto-Cooling-System-
Read data from the sensor and Control the actuator according to the reading from the sensor

### IOT
  Creating an interactive environment
  
  Network of devices connected together
     
     
### Sensor


  Electronic element
  
  Converts physical quantity into electrical signals 
  
  Can be analog or digital
  
        #### DHT Sensor
   
         Digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DHT)
         PIN1,2,3,4(fromleftto right)
         PIN1-3.3V-5VPower supply
         PIN2-Data
         PIN3-Null
         PIN4-Ground
  
###  Actuator
  Mechanical/Electro-mechanical device
  
  Converts energy into motion
  
  Mainly used to provide controlled motion to other components

        #### Relay
         Mechanical/electromechanical switch
         3 output terminals (left to right)  NO (normal open):
         Common
         NC (normal close)
